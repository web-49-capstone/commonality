# Different than meetup.com in that they do larger events at times, we're more finding partners/pairs/groups for something without a strict schedule
- E.g. finding a tennis partner, a gaming partner, a (small) group to hike with

## MAIN GOAL - Pairing profiles together with common interests.
- Limiting to groups of 2-10
    -  More intimate groups, NOT large events / meetups

### Profile-driven
- Add interest tags to your own profile
- Search for people by tags
- Suggest people based on tags

### Group sizes
- Specify if you want to find 1 person, 3, 5, etc. for a specific search

### Pairing
- Search for people? Or automatically pair?
    - One-sided matching (not like tinder) where you can send a message to someone with shared interests
        - Can't message anyone who doesn't share at least 1 tag
- Suggested groups to message / suggested users to invite to your group
- NOT providing a big list for people - offering up random profiles with the same interest.
- NOT a friend-finder app. Keeping it specific to the activity you want to do.

### Groups
- Once matches are made, it starts a group.
    - Users can change max group sizes
    - 1-on-1 matches don't make groups
    - Groups need an admin user? To kick people out / set group name / etc
        - Groups can have a max size (set by admin)

### Communication -
- Keep it on the app
- Date setting tool - with small calendar in-app but google calendar push as well
- Polling - take votes on best times to meet
- Needs a list of your connections and a way to add/remove connections
- Steal thing from meetup.com that offers up mutual friends / friends with mutual interests to current connections

### 2 Main Functions:
- 1-on-1 meetings (don't need polls, groups, etc)
- 3+ meetings (more functionality)

### User Profiles
- Name, age, photo, about me, and list of interests
- Checkbox on interests for absolute beginner or not (willing to be a mentor)
- Message user option
    - Block/report user option
