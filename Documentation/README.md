# commonality
Capstone Project for Deep Dive Bootcamp - Full Stack Web Development (cohort 49)

The intention behind this program is to connect people to other people on the basis of shared interests. Today, a problem exacerbated (but not caused) by the Covid-19 pandemic, faces most people in the USA: we are more isolated and less connected than ever, and despite being constantly connected it can feel harder than ever to meet new people. 

Meetup groups exist, but tend to be larger groups and more event-based. Commonality(tm) aims to offer individuals a platform to meet other individuals - or small groups - with specific activities in mind.
