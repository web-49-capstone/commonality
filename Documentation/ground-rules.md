# Commonality Project Ground Rules

## Communication
- Use Slack as our main communication
  - Try to respond to Slack messages within 1 hour
- Text messaging second communication
- Speak up if you feel you're getting too little or too much assigned

## When will we get together?
- Every Friday at lunch we will set a date to meet for the next week based on availability
- We will meet at the STEMulus center for now, if we need to meet on weekends we'll meet at Satellite on Wyoming & Montgomery (or adjust)

## Projects
- Complete tasks assigned to you, or ask for help
- Finish things by deadlines, notify the group as soon as you know if you can't
### How will everyone pull their weight?
- We'll start by assigning equal workloads to each member
- If clear strengths / weaknesses arise we can reassess duties
- M/W/F standing meetings to keep track of progress, issues, successess, etc.
### How will we celebrate success?
- High fives all around!

## Attitudes
- Treat other team members with respect, don't be shitty
- No bad ideas in a brainstorm
- No personal attacks
- Communicate openly & give constructive feedback
- Stay on topic
- Treat everyone equally
- Celebrate accomplishments on Slack or elsewhere
- Address conflict ASAP

## Conflicts
- If two people have conflicting ideas:
  - First discuss openly about pros/cons of each idea
  - See if AI has a clear favorite and reassess
  - Third member gets to break the tie and vote for their favorite idea
  - OR back to the drawing board
