<h2>Name: Sammy Servesg√ºt</h2>
<h3>Age: 29</h3>

<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Sammy is a working professional in an office setting. They push paper and press buttons all day fixing decimal errors in a corporate database. Sammy also loves to play tennis, but has trouble finding a tennis partner. Sammy's significant other, workmates, and old friends are not interested in starting to play tennis. Sammy doesn't want to teach someone new, but wants to find a reliable partner to play with on weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Technology: </strong>Sammy is very good with technology, has competed in MS Excel charity tournaments, and uses a Windows desktop and Android phone. They have unlimited data and access to wifi everywhere but the car (and the courts).</p>

<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Sammy is a busy person. Sammy wants to search for tennis partners while running from one meeting to another, on their lunch break at work, or for a few minutes before making dinner each night. Sammy expects a lot of their tech, and will drop an app quickly if they become frustrated by the UX or find the program unhelpful.</p>

<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>Part of their frustration in finding a tennis partner is the time and effort it takes to meet people and then find out if they also like tennis. Sammy wants to get straight to the point. "I'm not here to hang, talk about work, or have coffee. I don't have much time and I want to play some damn tennis," says Sammy. Sammy needs a way to find someone to do this activity with while cutting through the rest of the fluff that comes with meeting new people.</p>

<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Sammy has one concern: can they meet a tennis partner who wants to agree on a time, get to the courts, play a few matches, and go on with their lives. They would be willing to meet up during lunch breaks, after work, or on weekends.</p>

<p><strong>User Story: </strong>As a user, I will match with other people who want to play tennis in my area and chat with them about skill levels and availability. When I feel I've met a good match, I'll use the chat function to schedule a time and place to play.</p>
