</ul>

<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong></p>

    <li>Sammy expects a lot of their tech, and will drop an app quickly if they become frustrated by the UX or find the program unhelpful.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Part of their frustration in finding a tennis partner is the time and effort it takes to meet people and then find out if they also like tennis.</li>
    <li>Sammy wants to get straight to the point. "I'm not here to hang, talk about work, or have coffee. I don't have much time and I want to play some damn tennis"</li>
    <li>Sammy needs a way to find someone to do this activity with while cutting through the rest of the fluff that comes with meeting new people.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sammy has one goal: to meet a tennis partner, agree on a time, get to the courts, and play a few matches.</li>
    <li>They would be willing to meet up during lunch breaks, after work, or on weekends.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Story:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>As a user of the app, I will try weekly to match with other people who want to play tennis in my area.</li>
    <li>As a user of the app, I will check my messages daily to chat with matches about skill level and availability.</li>
    <li>When I feel I've met a good match, I'll use the chat function to schedule a time and place to play with my partner.</li>
</ul>
