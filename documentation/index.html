  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>We are creating Commonality to help bring people together. Today, people are more connected than ever but also more isolated. Adults are more transient than ever before, and it's not uncommon for an individual or couple to move away from their hometown to somewhere where they have little to no existing connections. Our aim is to facilitate in-person interactions by introducing people with similar interests and giving them a space to do what they are interested in, together.</p>
  <p>The application allows users to create profiles, select their interests, and match with users based on interests. Built using technologies such as JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS, the project emphasizes both user-friendly design and practical functionality. Key features include user authentication, interest-based filtering, and a responsive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
