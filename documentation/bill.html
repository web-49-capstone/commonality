        <p><strong>Name:</strong>Bill L. Randall</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 28</p>
        <p><strong>Occupation:</strong>Front Desk Cashier at a Tabletop Games Store</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Bill works at a local tabletop games store where he provides insight and
            knowledge to people who come into the store. He loves a lot of tabletop RPGs and mini-figure painting.
            He finds that not a lot of his closer friends or family members share his same interest, and wants
            to meet people who like the same things he does.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Bill uses a top-of-the-line gaming PC complete with a high-end AMD Ryzen
            processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card. He built his pc himself and customizes his desktop
            to reflect his interests and media likings. He has a 4K gaming monitor with a high refresh rate along with
            a quality gaming keyboard and mouse. He uses a Samsung Galaxy S25 with customized software and with a
            lightweight
            Linux distribution on it as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Bill gets along with everybody and enjoys forming bonds with people
            he meets. Whenever he meets someone new, he likes to find out more about them and what things they are into.
            He also is not bashful on sharing his interests and passions with whoever is curious. He is very
            interested in meeting others who share his common interests to have closer bonds with people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Bill has used similar apps like Meetup or Reddit, but he finds that
            the general nature of those apps make it hard for him to make those close connections. Also, the
            inconsistency of people of who attend events from those apps makes it hard for him to establish friendships.
            Also, the fact that those apps don't have a native way to connect with specific people leaves him wanting
            something more personalized.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Bill wants to be able to grow closer with people based on a shared love for things
            like tabletop RPGs and fantasy-adventure video games. He is dedicated to his current friends, but meeting
            those with similar interests will make him feel more connected with others and less lonely
            in his hobbies.</p>

        <h3>User Story:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> As someone with niche likes, I want to be able to see what a person is interested in with
          fine details.</li>
          <li> As a user of technology, I want to be able to have the ability to reach out to someone who connects
               with me as smoothly and as efficiently as possible.</li>
          <li> As someone with niche likes, I want to be able to have my profile visible and open to those
               specifically with my similar likes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Use Case:</h3>
        <p>Bill's family member at a family gathering was talking to him about a new website where users can connect
           with similar interests and hobbies. Having been left wanting more from other similar sites, he brings up
           concerns about possibly not finding others with his specific interests, and wants something more personal. His
           family member tells him that the site caters to a vast array of interests, and tells him that it is less
           generalized and more tethered to the user. Bill is now very interested after seeing the initial homepage
           on his phone.</p>
        <p><strong>Precondition:</strong> Goes to the website on his computer with curiosity.</p>
        <p><strong>Post-Condition:</strong> He is reaches out to a match that has a lot of his same interests, and they
        make plans to set up a DnD campaign.</p>
        <h3>Interaction Flow:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Bill opens up the website on his desktop computer</li>
            <li> Bill gets a detailed splash screen that gives him options to signup or login.</li>
            <li> Bill creates a profile and puts in his various interests, and includes his passions in his profile.</li>
            <li> Bill is instantly taken to a page where he can match with others and groups based on his specified
                 interests.</li>
            <li> Bill gets a notification saying someone matched with him and wants to connect.</li>
            <li> Upon clicking on the notification, Bill checks put the user's profile and looks at his bio and profile
                 banners. along with his included likes and interests.</li>
